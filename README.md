# Welcome to My GitHub Page

Hello! My name is **Alian Zulfiqar Ali** and I am currently a student at the University of Applied Sciences, majoring in **Computer Science**. My focus areas are **Software Engineering** and **Data Science**.

I'm currently interested in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Data Engineering**, and **Data Science**. However, I'm always curious! I love to learn in general, especially a new stack or technology. My focus right now is to learn the most I can in terms of different technologies and specialize later!

On this GitHub page, you will find projects that showcase the skills and knowledge I have acquired during my studies. These projects include:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Algorithms and projects related to data analysis and machine learning.
- **Database Projects**: A project where I have worked extensively with SQL.
- **Wireless Networks Seminar Paper**: My scientific work on the seminar project "Wireless Networks," where I explored the topic of "Architecture of Current Mobile Networks (LTE/5G)."

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work and contributions. Below is an example of some LaTeX formatted text demonstrating my interests in data science and software engineering:
